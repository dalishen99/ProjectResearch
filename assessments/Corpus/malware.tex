Folder path: ./Malware/

\paragraph{}    
During this project research, multiple scripts used by attackers to download malicious
binaries in order to compromised servers, have been collected. In this corpus, an extract
of those download scripts and malware are gathered.
Each folder names are built as following:
\begin{center}
[IP/URL where the script has been downloaded] - [Original script name]
\end{center}
Then, in the root of this folder is stored a file called dl\_script which is the first
script downloaded by the attackers. This script is usually used to download malware binaries.
In the case where it is possible to download malware binaries, all of them have been downloaded
and stored in a sub-directory called "malware". In this folder is archived malware binaries 
with their original names.
