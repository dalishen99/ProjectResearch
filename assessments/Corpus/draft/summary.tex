\textsc{SUMMARY}\\[0.5cm]

\paragraph{}
This document consists of gathering documents that have been produced during the
project research, apart from the dissertation and logbook. The aim of my project is to
perform a systematic analysis of attacks on a honeypot. Consequently, this corpus contains
two SQL databases, a list of gathered malware, four bash/python scripts and two files containing a
list of attempted passwords and usernames during bruteforce attacks of the server.
